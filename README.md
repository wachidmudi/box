### Publish to Glitch
Create a ZIP file of the files or folders you want   
Upload it to the assets folder in your project, click it and click `Copy Url`   
Navigate to `Settings` > `Advance Options` > `Open Console` in your project or click `Terminal` on bottom bar   

In the console, first we want to pull the zip file from the url   
```sh
$ wget -O file.zip https:///url-to-your-zip
```

Then we want to extract it to the current directory
```sh
$ unzip file.zip -d .
```

Then we want to remove the zip file
```sh
$ rm file.zip
```

Finally we want to refresh our app so the new files are shown in the editor
```sh
$ refresh
```
